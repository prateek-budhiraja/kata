# Kata

This repository contains my solutions to various problems or "Katas" using the JavaScript programming language, following a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach. .

## How to Use

Each folder in this repository represents a different kata problem. Within each folder, you will find a README file that describes the problem statement and requirements. Additionally, you will find a problem.test.js file that contains the test cases for the problem, and a problem.js file that contains my solution to the problem, following the TDD approach.

To use this repository, simply clone or download the repository to your local machine. Then, navigate to the folder of the problem you want to solve and open the problem.test.js file. Read the problem statement and the test cases provided. Implement your solution in the problem.js file following the TDD approach, and run the test cases to verify that your solution is correct.
